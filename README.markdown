siuying-kindle-highlights
============

*Get your Kindle highlights via Amazon's Kindle site*

This is a Kindle Highlight API build on top of [speric implementation](https://github.com/speric/kindle-highlights).

**Required gems**

* asin
* Mechanize

The asin gem assumes you have an Associates tracking code, and Product API credentials.  A handy guide for setting up the asin gem can be found at:

[http://aws.amazon.com/code/3982](http://aws.amazon.com/code/3982).

The kindle-highlights gem depends on the asin gem to grab data about the product from which the highlight came, and will not work without asin being set up properly.

**Install**
	
	gem install kindle-highlights
**Use**

	require 'kindle-highlights'

	# to create a new KindleHighlight object, give it your Amazon email address and password	
	kindle = KindleHighlight.new("foo@bar.com", "password")
	
	# setup asin    
  ASIN::Configuration.configure do |config|
    config.secret        = "secret"
    config.key           = "key"
    config.associate_tag = "associate_tag"
  end

  # fetch items
  kindle.scrape_highlights

  # fetch more items, if available
  while kindle.has_more?
		kindle.scrape_highlights  
	end
  
  # get all fetched items
	kindle.highlights.each do |highlight|
		highlight.annotation_id # => a unique value for each highlight, generated by Amazon
		highlight.content # => the actual highlight text
		highlight.note # => any note attached with the highlight
		highlight.end_location # => end_location of the annotation
		highlight.asin # => the Amazon ASIN for the highlight's product
		highlight.author # => author of the book from which the highlight is taken
		highlight.title # => title of the book from which the highlight is taken
		highlight.details_url # => URL to the book
		highlight.image_url # => Image of the book
	end
